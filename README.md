# Dashboard-on-Drug-Related-Mortality
💊 Drug Overdose Deaths: A Data-Driven Comparison between India &amp; the US 📈
In this project, I developed a comprehensive, comparative analytics dashboard to explore and contrast drug-related mortality trends in India and the United States using two distinct datasets:

🧾 US Dataset: Drug overdose death records from the CDC, detailing cause of death (Heroin, Fentanyl, Cocaine, etc.), demographics (age, gender, race), and geographic data (city/state of residence, injury, and death).

🏥 India Dataset: Hospital-reported drug mortality data broken down by state/UT and age categories, highlighting below-14 mortality, among other health indicators.


🔧 Tools & Techniques Used:
✅ Microsoft Excel (Power Pivot, Power Query)

✅ ETL Process: Data cleaning, filtering invalid year values, transforming string and numeric fields, handling inconsistencies (e.g., mixed year labels like "Total (All India)")

✅ Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts for summarization and quick insights

✅ Slicers & Timelines for dynamic filtering by year, state, age group, gender, substance

✅ DAX Measures for creating custom KPIs (e.g., Deaths per Substance, Mortality % per Year)

✅ Macros to automate repetitive actions (like resetting filters)

✅ Data Modeling via Power Pivot to connect the Indian and US datasets meaningfully
📊 Key Visualizations:
📈 Line Charts for year-wise mortality trends

🧱 Stacked Column Charts to show state-wise substance use and death patterns

👩‍🦰👨‍🦰 Demographic Pyramid Charts to compare male/female deaths across age groups

🗺️ Heatmaps to show overdose hotspots by region/state

🧩 Comparative Views side-by-side: India vs USA trends on same axis
🎯 Project Goal:
To bridge public health insights across countries by analyzing drug mortality patterns using a comparative data dashboard, empowering stakeholders, researchers, and policymakers with visual evidence that can spark awareness, debate, and action.
